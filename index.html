    <h3>Income & Expense Analysis in the United States from 1980 -
        2020
    </h3>

    According to census.gov, per capita income is defined as the "mean income
    computed for every man, woman, and child in a
    particular group including those living in group quarters. <br>It is derived
    by
    dividing the aggregate income of a particular
    group by the total population in that group. This measure is rounded to the
    nearest whole dollar."
    <br><br>
    It is clear that the average income has grown steadily over time. During
    this forty year timespan it increased by a factor of 5.05.
