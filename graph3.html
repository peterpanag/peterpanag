    <h2>Income & Expense Analysis in the United States from 1980 -
        2020
    </h2>

    <h3>The average salary in the United States has not kept up with the cost of
        living during this time period.</h3>

    The most important factor in this analysis is the consumer price index.
    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time
    in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods
    and services.
    <br><br>
    The average index price from 1980 - 2020 has increased by a factor of 60.5.
    In
    comparison, the per capita income has increased by a factor of 5.05. From
    2014 and on, the
    consumer price index began to increase more rapidly. It almost looks like an
    exponential graph.
    <br><br>
    The rate that it is accelerating is unsustainable for the average American.
    With every year that passes, the average salary loses buying power.
    If the American salary does not start to increase to keep up with this rate,
    most of the population will be in poverty and along with it, the complete
    elimination of the middle class.
