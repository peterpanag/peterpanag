<h3>Per Capita Income & Expense Analysis in the United States from 1980 - 2020
</h3>

According to census.gov, per capita income is defined as the "mean income
computed for every man, woman, and child in a
particular group including those living in group quarters. It is derived by
dividing the aggregate income of a particular
group by the total population in that group. This measure is rounded to the
nearest whole dollar."
