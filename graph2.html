    <h2>Income & Expense Analysis in the United States from 1980 - 2020
    </h2>

    <h3>The average salary in the United States has kept up with oil prices
        during this time period.</h3>

    Even though its importance has been slowly dwindling in recent years due to
    the
    emergence of electric vehicles, oil has been and still remains a critical
    resource in the everyday life of most Americans. When its price is elevated,
    Americans
    directly feel the effects. Due to the transportation of almost every good
    relying on oil,
    expensive oil creates an expensive world.
    <br><br>
    Oil prices in general have kept up with the growth rate of the average
    salary.
    There was a period of elevated prices during the time period from 2006 to
    2014.
    Thankfully, the price recovered. From 2014 to 2020, its price fluctuates
    around
    $60.00.
